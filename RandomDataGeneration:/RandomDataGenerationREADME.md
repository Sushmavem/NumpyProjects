# Random Dataset Generation with NumPy and pandas

This project generates a random dataset of individuals with attributes like name, age, height, and weight. It uses NumPy to generate random data and pandas to organize and display it in a tabular format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy

## Project Overview
The script generates a dataset with the following columns:

Name: A list of 10 predefined names (e.g., Alice, Bob, Mary, etc.).
Age: Randomly generated ages between 18 and 60.
Height: Randomly generated heights between 5.0 and 6.5 feet.
Weight: Randomly generated weights between 50 and 100 kg.
The dataset is then stored in a pandas DataFrame and displayed.

## How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy
Run the script using:

python random_dataset.py
The script will generate and display the dataset in the terminal.
