# Matrix Operations with NumPy

This project demonstrates basic matrix operations using NumPy in Python. It includes functions for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, determinant calculation, and inverse of matrices. The operations are applied to two sample matrices to demonstrate the functionality of each operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy

Project Overview

The script defines the following matrix operations:

Matrix Addition: Adds two matrices element-wise.
Matrix Subtraction: Subtracts one matrix from another element-wise.
Matrix Multiplication: Multiplies two matrices using the dot product.
Matrix Transpose: Transposes a matrix by flipping it over its diagonal.
Matrix Determinant: Calculates the determinant of a matrix.
Matrix Inverse: Computes the inverse of a matrix.
How to Run
