# NumPy Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates basic data analysis using NumPy and pandas. The dataset contains information on individuals, including their age, height, and weight. By using pandas to load the data and NumPy for computation, this project calculates key statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and the minimum and maximum values for each of the attributes.

## Requirements
